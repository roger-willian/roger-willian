## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working developing microservices in C
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently re-learning Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that helps reducing the impacts of climate change
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating an APM client in C
- âš¡ Fun fact: if people stop fighting over small things and started to actually care and love each other the world would be a much better place to live (it's fun because it's true)
